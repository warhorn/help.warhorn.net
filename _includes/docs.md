# Getting Set Up

1. Create an account (select email address / password or Facebook integration). If you already have an account, skip to the next step.
2. Set your time zone. Warhorn is used globally, so setting your time zone is critical. (Account section)
3. Input your Paizo Organized Play ID number in the Organized Play section of your account.
4. Optionally, link your Social accounts (Discord or Facebook; Google+ is still listed, but you can use this to link your Google account)
   a. If you choose to sign up for Discord using your Facebook account, your account will automatically be linked.

# Creating an Event

1. Click on Submit an Event
   a. Provide a name for the event. The event name will also be a hotlink on the Warhorn site to your event’s page, so make sure to name it something easily identifiable. For example, a lodge at the Ellsworth station in Antarctica might be named “Ellsworth Antarctica Organized Play.”
   b. Set the event as a one-time event or recurring event. By default, the “This is a one time event” box is checked, and requires a date or date range to be entered. If your event is to be recurring, uncheck the one time event box. No dates will be required for entry at this time (this will be handled later).
   c. Provide an event location. If it is to be held online, put a check in the “This event is held online” box. If the event is not to be held online - a city, country, and state are required (these lines disappear if you check the online event box mentioned above).
   d. If the event is to be private, check the “This event is private” box.
   e. Place any additional comments relevant to event approval in the comments box. These comments are read by the Warhorn staff during approval, but are not otherwise used.
   f. Select “Submit your event.”
   g. Wait for Warhorn staff to email you to tell you your event site is live. This will give you access to the event overview page.
2. Access your event overview
   a. Make any alterations needed to finish setting up the event by first clicking the “Setup” dropdown button at the top right of the screen.
   Title (if changes are needed)
   Your contact information
   Dates (again, this will only be required for a one-time event)
   Location
   Details
   This is where you can get specific about the event, and should contain enough information for players to know how your event will work.
   Fee Settings
   If your event requires any fees for participation, whether a badge fee, a table fee, charitable donation fee, or any other fee, players and GMs alike should be made aware in advance.
   Roles
   Each role has predefined permissions that you can customize.
   Default roles are:
   Attendee
   GM
   Staff
   Additional roles can be created and roles assigned, as you see fit.
   Options
   When the event is ready, put a check in the box labeled “Attendees can register for this event”.
   Optionally, you can also have a custom registration message sent to anyone when they register for the event.
   Discord connection is set to “Ignore by” default, meaning attendees are not required to have their Discord account connected to their Warhorn account, however, it is highly suggested that, for online events, this is changed to Required, if your lodge uses Discord for voice chat.
   Signup options
   You can automatically clear registrants to participate (leaving this box unchecked makes it require a manual review and approval)
   You can enable a GM Signup List
   Additionally, you can permit the GM to manage the details of their sessions and / or allow GMs to see participation contact info by checking the appropriate boxes here, which will then be used as the default permissions for every GM sign up.
   Enable waitlisting
   This can be used for two primary reasons - to let players sign up in case of someone backing out, and to gauge player interest.  
   If the waitlist size warrants it, it would be advisable to attempt to find additional GM(s), if the desire is there to play at the specifically set date and time
   Alternatively, if there is not a desire by all players to play at the scheduled date and time, it could be used to set up an additional session at another time.
   Waitlists are ordered automatically (first in, first out) by Warhorn, and cannot be altered by event staff. In the event a new session is added and it will pull players from the waitlist, that will be automated based on signup order.
   Enable monthly calendar view will allow users to look at your scheduled sessions by either an Agenda view or a Calendar view, permitting them to jump to specific dates.
   Services
   This specific setting is only useful if you have a Facebook page, which then adds a Facebook Like button or box to your event page.
   The button immediately to the left of the Setup button is the Manage button.
   This button allows you to make changes to the schedule, scenarios, registrations, venues, and registration fees (each has its own listing on the dropdown menu). **NOTE** - For ongoing games, such as Organized Play games, the two that will be used most frequently will be Schedule and Scenarios.
   Manage Schedule
   To add your first session, click on the Add The Next Occurrence button
   In the new window, set the start date, start time, time zone, and session duration, and hit save.
   Once the occurrence is added, click the Add Another Slot button if you plan to have multiple sessions, and repeat the above steps.
   Click on the time slot that is now under the date of your occurrence
   On this new screen, click on Add A Session
   In the new window, select the scenario you are planning to run for this slot (I would advise following the steps in the Manage Scenarios area prior to the Manage Schedule area, as the official scenarios that can be chosen in this section need to be added prior to scheduling them in order to link directly to the scenario description and information on Paizo’s website) by beginning to type it in.
   Starfinder’s prefix is SFS. Pathfinder prefixes are PF1 and PF2, respectively.
   Select or verify the language the game will be run in
   Set the number of tables and number of players per table (keeping in mind that the maximum number of OP players, by rule, is 6)
   Add any specific notes for the session and scenario
   Make sure there is a check next to Active before saving, or your new session will not show on the agenda or calendar views of your event.
   Click on the Scenario name link that will have now been created in order to manage the session further.
   For Online: This is the most critical portion, as it indicates which VTT is in use as well as where the Discord server information and invitations will be placed for online games.. It also permits you to set up session specific permissions for each role vs. the global permissions previously mentioned.
   Click on Add Virtual Tabletop and select the appropriate choice from the list. **NOTE** There is an “Other” choice, in the event the one you use is not listed.
   Input the appropriate server information or link for web apps to share with players. **NOTE** - For Fantasy Grounds Unity, you will also need to choose if this is a Cloud or a LAN game and provide the GM Name and the table password, if there is one.
   Provide the name of the VTT (Mine is named “Starfinder Society Organized Play”, and users will search for me either by my GM name, the VTT name, or both)
   Add any notes and hit save
   Add Voice/Chat Services, if you are using any
   Select the appropriate service from the dropdown menu
   Provide the Server Invite Link (for Discord, you will also need to provide the names of the text and voice channels, as well as any invitation links for the specific channels).
   Add the Server Name, any notes you feel applicable, and hit save.
   For In Person events, it will work similarly, choosing the venues previously added instead of choosing a VTT and Voice service.
   It is possible to use this feature to set up a singular event for a lodge, adding all VOs as Staff to then give them access to schedule their own sessions instead of each needing to set up their own event. Boston PFS is already doing this.
   Manage Scenarios
   Add Global Scenario
   This option has access to Paizo’s database of scenarios to choose from to add to your event.
   Pathfinder is broken out into PF1 and PF2 as the prefixes, and either AP or Mod to select adventure paths or scenarios.
   Starfinder’s prefix is SF, and is broken out as AP, Mod (currently only used for the Free RPG Day Skitter Adventures), or SFS #-##, with the numbers indicating the season and scenario number.
   Add Custom Scenario
   Provide the scenario name
   Leave checked or remove the check (as required) from the box indicating if this is an Organized Play Campaign Scenario.
   Type in a few characters for the game system
   Optional fields can be used to include the following:
   Author
   Min Level
   Max Level
   Number of players per table
   Scenario blurb
   Cover art image URL
   External URL
   Custom Copy
   Manage Registrations
   In this section, you can clear people to sign up for sessions (if you do not have automatic clearing turned on), unclear them (if need be) or add registrations. This section also shows you if any of the users have not paid their fee (if there is one).
   A note on adding registrations - if the user you are attempting to add to your event already has an account on Warhorn, this will not work, as using this action creates a new Warhorn account for the user credentials you are submitting.
   By clicking on an existing registered user’s name on the list, you will be able to go into their registration and add them to roles other than the default Attendee role.
   Manage Venues
   Here, you can add in-person venues, public or private, for inclusion in your event
   You will need the following information to add a venue:
   Venue name
   Address
   City
   Country
   State
   Zip Code
   Phone Number
   Be sure to review the “Visibility” area of the venue entry, as it defaults to public, permitting anyone on the site to see the address and phone number of the venue, which you may not want if you’re also using this for your home game and put in your personal information for the venue information.
   Registration Fees
   Add a Base fee
   Set a name for the fee
   Set the fee amount
   Default fee, Public fee, and Active fee.
   If there's one public active base fee, it will be automatically selected at registration time. If there is more than one public active base fee, the registrant will be required to select one of them, and the one chosen as default will be preselected.
   Add an Extra fee or Discount. **NOTE** - This will only show up if at least one public active extra fee/discount is configured. Each of these is an optional selection for the registrant.
   Set a name for the fee
   Set the fee amount
   Public fee, and Active Fee (there is help text on the site about these, though some of it is not very clear, aside from that leaving the box checked for Public Fee makes it open for everyone on the site to see, and the others may only truly apply if you have a fee structure or discounted fees based on volunteering or early sign-ups).

Finding and Registering for an Event
On the main Warhorn page, there are three options to search for an event - Games, Conventions, and Campaigns. Going into any of these opens up search options to find games to play or GM. Once you get to the specific session, it will show if there are openings for GMs, Players, or both (or if it’s waitlisted). At that point, you can register for the event, and once cleared, you can sign up to either GM or play.

Make sure to read about the event on its home page to ensure you understand the lodge’s signup process and other rules.
